# Dynamic_Programming and Recursion
There are several programms that focuses on problem solving using dynamic programming in python and C++

* 01_knapsack (3 approaches):

  1.Using Recursion

  2.Using Recursion+Memoization

  3.Using Dynamic Programming

* Unbounded Knapsack 

* Subset Sum

  1.Subset Sum using dp related to knapsack approach 
  
  2.Leetcode Problem of Partition Equall Subset Sum :- Partition subset into 2 equall parts
  
  3.Subset Sum Count :- Count number of subset from array given sum k
